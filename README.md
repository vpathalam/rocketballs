During the Summer Rocketship session of the year 2018, three competitors keep track of how many balls make impact on 
the bodies of Mark, Brian, and Vikram from neighboring table tennis infrastructure. Commits are made on a daily weekday basis.

In order to qualify for a point, the ball must:
  1. Hit your body anywhere above your knees (eg. hitting your foot does not count)
  2. Hit your computer, keyboard, or monitor.
  3. Bounce directly in front of you on your desk.
  4. Any other ping pong related disturbance deemed by the Tribunal to be adequately disruptive.
